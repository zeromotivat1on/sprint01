        <h1>Alduin</h1>

            Alduin, sometimes referred to as the World Eater, the Twilight God,
            and the First Dragon, is a mighty dragon who ruled over Skyrim during the Merethic Era. 
            Worshipped as a god-king by the ancient Nords through the Dragon Cult, Alduin is considered the wellspring of the Nordic pantheon,
            as well as the harbinger of the apocalypse, and is believed to have a pivotal role in the reshaping of the world.
            Nordic legends assert that Alduin is a god-like entity which destroyed the last world in order to begin the current one, 
            in what is considered the creation of a new Kalpa. He bears resemblance to the Yokudan god Satakal,
            the Argonian god Atakota, the Khajiiti god Alkhan, and the Skaal know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer,
            though scholars speculate the All-Maker is the Skaal interpretation of Alduin.
            As a result, Alduin has been seen both as creator and destroyer by various cultures, 
            with his existence predating the creation of Nirn itself. There are legends of his battles with the god Shor at the beginning of time.
            Much like Nordic legends, Khajiiti songs assert Alkhan was slain by Lorkhaj and his companions,
            and that he will return in time, as he is immortal. Alduin also conspired with Orkey to reduce all the Nords to children, 
            until he was again defeated by Shor by request of King Wulfharth. Alduin is also known in old tales for his ability to devour the souls of the dead, 
            and by doing so he can increase his power. Alduin is considered the wellspring of the Nordic pantheon, 
            a depiction that bears resemblance to those of Satakal and Atakota in their respective pantheons, 
            in which they are represented as the force that enabled the et'Ada to form.
            Imperial scholars speculate that Alduin is the name by which the ancient Nords knew Akatosh, 
            the dragon god of time and later patron deity of the Empire. However, some Nords consider this a mischaracterization, 
            maintaining that Alduin and Akatosh are indeed regarded as separate beings in Nordic legend. 
            Alduin called himself the "Firstborn of Akatosh." According to Paarthurnax, Alduin's dragon peers considered him Akatosh's most acclaimed "creation." 
            According to the Khajiiti pantheon, Alduin is the firstborn of Akha, 
            who is the source of all dragons and gods associated with the concept of time according to the pantheon, suggesting that Alduin predates Akatosh, 
            or Alkosh according to the Khajiiti pantheon. According to the Yokudan pantheon and Argonian pantheon Alduin formed from the conflict of Anu and Padomay, 
            and is in essence the Aurbis. Some sources suggest he was split from Akatosh, or possibly the greater Aka-Tusk, 
            and that Alduin embodies a particular aspect of the time god.
